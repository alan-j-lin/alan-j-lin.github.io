title: Metis Project 1 - Analyzing MTA Data
---
### The Setup

In the first week of the Metis Bootcamp, we were assigned a group project. This project consisted of being hired by the WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) organization to help organize a list of optimal flyering locations for their upcoming summer charity gala in NYC. The only requirement was that we had to utilize the MTA turnstile data provided through the NYC Open Data Portal.

### Analysis

In being a group project the group was immediately divided between the group that was going to handle the MTA data and people that were going to help merge that with outside data sources, I was assigned to the latter. As WTWY was an organization focused on increasing the amount of women in tech, we decided to first idealize the type of person that we would try to target to attend this gala.  

#### The Target: Becky  

Meet Becky. She is 25 years old and both lives and works in New York City. Becky works as a software engineer for one of the top tech firms in the city and has a passion for dogs and coffee.

With the target portfolio in mind, we decided to choose our outside data sources to optimize for the number of Beckys. 

| Parameter   | Corollary              | Data Source         |
