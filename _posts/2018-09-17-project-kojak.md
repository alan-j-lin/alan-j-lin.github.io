title: Improving Youtubeâ€™s Demonetization Algorithm for Sex Educators
---

According to an article in the Journal of Adolescent Health by Hall et. al titled [The State of Sex Education in the United States] there are currently less than 15 states that require sex education be medically accurate. At the same, they observed that while the quality of sex education in the United States went down from 2006 to 2014, there was an analogous trend where teen pregnancies when down and the use of contraception for teenagers went up during the time period. They stated that:

 ```

 These coincident trends suggest that adolescents are receiving information about birth control and condoms elsewhere.

 ```

By elsewhere, I think a natural interpretation would mean the Internet. In particular, I believe that Youtube is a platform where viewers can find great sex education related videos. Some content creators of particular import in this space are Lindsay Doe (a clinical sexologist that runs the [Sexplanations] channel), [Hannah Witton], and [Stevie Boebie].
